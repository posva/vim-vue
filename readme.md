# vim-vue

Vim syntax highlighting for [Vue
components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html).

This was initially forked from
[darthmall/vim-vue](https://github.com/darthmall/vim-vue). I already have an
implementation for this but found his code much cleaner. That's why I created a
new version instead of a PR.

## Installation

### Install with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

```viml
Plugin 'posva/vim-vue'
```

### Install with [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

```bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle && \
git clone https://github.com/posva/vim-vue.git
```

### Install without a plugin manager (Vim 8)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/posva/vim-vue.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-vue
```

### Integration with [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) or [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale)

Currently only `eslint` is available. Please make sure
[eslint](http://eslint.org/) and
[eslint-plugin-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue) are installed
and properly [configured](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue#rocket-usage):

```bash
npm i -g eslint eslint-plugin-vue
```

## Contributing

If your language is not getting highlighted open an issue or a PR with the fix.
You only need to add a line to the `syntax/vue.vim` file.

Don't forget to write [Vader](https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim) tests for
the code you write. You can run the tests by executing `make test` in the
terminal.

## FAQ

### Where is Jade?

[Jade has been renamed to pug](https://github.com/pugjs/jade/issues/2184).
Therefore you have to replace all your `jade` occurrences with `pug`. The new
plugin for `pug` can be found on [the same repository](https://github.com/digitaltoad/vim-pug)
(the name has already been updated).

### How to use commenting functionality with multiple languages in Vue files?

#### [tcomment](https://github.com/tomtom/tcomment_vim)

tcomment has some support for Vue files with multiple languages, without any extra configuration.

#### [caw.vim](https://github.com/tyru/caw.vim)

caw.vim features built-in support for file context through [context_filetype.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/context_filetype.vim). Just install both plugins and context-aware commenting will work in most files. The fenced code is detected by predefined regular expressions.

#### [NERDCommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter)

<details>
<summary>
To use NERDCommenter with Vue files, you can use its "hooks" feature to
temporarily change the filetype. <em>Click for an example.</em>
</summary>

```vim
let g:ft = ''
function! NERDCommenter_before()
  if &ft == 'vue'
    let g:ft = 'vue'
    let stack = synstack(line('.'), col('.'))
    if len(stack) > 0
      let syn = synIDattr((stack)[0], 'name')
      if len(syn) > 0
        exe 'setf ' . substitute(tolower(syn), '^vue_', '', '')
      endif
    endif
  endif
endfunction
function! NERDCommenter_after()
  if g:ft == 'vue'
    setf vue
    let g:ft = ''
  endif
endfunction
```

### _Vim slows down when using this plugin_ How can I fix that?
When checking for pre-processor languages, multiple syntax highlighting checks are done, which can slow down vim. You can trim down which pre-processors to use by setting `g:vue_pre_processors` to a whitelist of languages to support:

```vim
let g:vue_pre_processors = ['pug', 'scss']
```

To disable pre-processor languages altogether (only highlight HTML, JavaScript, and CSS):

```vim
let g:vue_pre_processors = []
```

Available pre-processors are: coffee, haml, handlebars, less, pug, sass, scss, slm, stylus, typescript

When `g:vue_pre_processors` is set to 'detect_on_enter' instead of a list, vim-vue will detect the pre-processors used when a file is opened, and load only their syntax files.

```vim
let g:vue_pre_processors = 'detect_on_enter'
```
